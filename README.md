# Mushroom Toxicity Analysis (SQL + Tableau)
This project analyzes a mushroom classification dataset to identify features associated with poisonous and edible mushrooms. The analysis was performed using SQL for data exploration and Tableau for visualization.

## Tools Used
• MySQL (via Navicat)

• SQL

• Tableau

• Kaggle dataset

## Project Goals
• Explore the distribution of edible vs poisonous mushrooms

• Build a visual dashboard for insights

## Key Questions
• What percentage of mushrooms are poisonous?

• Which odors are most associated with toxicity?

## Key Findings
• The dataset is nearly balanced between edible and poisonous mushrooms.

• Certain odors strongly correlate with poisonous mushrooms.

## SQL Analysis
The project uses SQL queries to:

• Calculate class distributions

• Compare features across classes

• Identify patterns in poisonous mushrooms

## Tableau Dashboard
The dashboard includes:
• Edible vs poisonous distribution

• Odor comparison by class

## Skills Demonstrated
• SQL data exploration

• Aggregation and grouping

• Data extraction for visualization

• Dashboard design in Tableau

• Communicating insights from categorical data

## Dataset
• Mushroom Classification Dataset
